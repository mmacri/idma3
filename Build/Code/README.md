# IDMA3 Snapshots — 2025-10-19

This package contains **best‑effort snapshots** captured from the live site using a text outline of the **rendered content** (post‑render visible copy), plus per‑page metadata. 
Due to this environment's no‑internet constraint for file generation, and Wix’s dynamic runtime, the literal `view-source` HTML and a fully captured rendered DOM are **not included**. 
If you later want full HTML/JS/CSS archives, run the capture script I provide in a desktop environment (I'll include instructions separately).

## Contents
- One folder per page, each containing:
  - `rendered_text.txt` — the verbatim visible text captured from the live page.
  - `metadata.json` — URL, notes, and capture timestamp.
  - `view_source.html` — *placeholder note* about dynamic Wix source (not captured here).
